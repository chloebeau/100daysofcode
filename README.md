# 100daysofcode
100 days of code, starting Feb 5th 2024

I will be following Angela Yu's 100 days of Python Udemy course in this challenge, while simultaneously working on my Javascript/Typescript/Node, GoLang,
and Rust knowledge and codebases. 

This will be my primary focus during the challenge, but please look at the other repositories too if you're interested in seeing progress with those
technologies as well!
